## Welcome to the Pet Matcher

## Objective

OkCreature has been designed to help potential adopters narrow the search for a pet. The matching feature allows users to filter our pet database based their lifestyle, their preferences and the level of care that they are able to provide. 

## Application Requirements

- Use React for the front end.
- Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.
- Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.
- Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
- Have a polished UI.
- Be responsive.
- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

Include authentication (JWT).

Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application)


## Motivation for Development

As we are currently in a pandemic, the rate of pets being bought and returned has grown substantially. These returned pets are not only sad and lonely, but are also back on the hunt to find a forever home. As each member in this group is a pet lover, we felt the need to create a webpage that can help bring pets and adopters together to fill this void!
