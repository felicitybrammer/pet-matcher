## Welcome to the Pet Matcher

## Objective

OkCreature has been designed to help potential adopters narrow the search for a pet. The matching feature allows users to filter our pet database based their lifestyle, their preferences and the level of care that they are able to provide. 

## Application Requirements

- Use React for the front end.
- Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.
- Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.
- Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
- Have a polished UI.
- Be responsive.
- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
- Include authentication (JWT).
- Protect sensitive API key information on the server.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
- Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application)

## Motivation for Development

As we are currently in a pandemic, the rate of pets being bought and returned has grown substantially. These returned pets are not only sad and lonely, but are also back on the hunt to find a forever home. As each member in this group is a pet lover, we felt the need to create a webpage that can help bring pets and adopters together to fill this void!

## User Story

I am looking to adopt a pet but I donâ€™t want to spend time searching and clicking through large databases. 
I want to be able to to enter my preferences and search criteria, and to have my results saved to my profile.
I want to be able to come back to the webpage and have my results be saved in on my profile page.

## User Workflow

WHEN I log in to my profile
THEN I see a list of summary cards with photos for each pet
WHEN I choose to take the matching quiz
THEN I have the option to select my preferences by checking boxes
WHEN I submit my quiz 
THEN my best matches are displayed
WHEN I log out and log back in
THEN my matches are persistent

## Challenges

- New skills and technologies - we chose a challenging project idea and had to work hard to find ways to solve problems that we had not encountered in lessons.
- Reading documentation and Stack Overflow - sometimes helpful and sometimes way too much information!

## Successes

- Planning: We planned extensively and did not move to work on the client side until our back end code was fully tested and complete
- Collaboration: We worked together on all the initial code and planning
- Communication: We communicated ALL the time
- New Ideas: We got to try some new ideas and to try writing code that was different from the lessons

## Directions for Future Development

This project has a lot of potential for development as this is only the MVP. We would like to enhance the user experience by:

- Allowing them to search for more pets
- Adding matching percentages
- Ability to retake the quiz
